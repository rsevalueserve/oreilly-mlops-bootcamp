# Day 1: MLOps / LLMOps Foundation – Bootcamp

Welcome to **Day 1** of the MLOps/LLMOps Bootcamp! This repository contains a set of **hands-on exercises** that introduce core concepts and tools for machine learning operations. You'll work with tools like **Git**, **MLflow**, **Docker**, and **CI/CD pipelines**, building real workflows from development to deployment.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 1, you will be able to:
- **Version control** ML code using Git
- **Track experiments** and model performance with MLflow
- **Containerize** ML applications using Docker
- **Build complete ML pipelines** with preprocessing, training, and deployment
- **Automate CI/CD** workflows using GitHub Actions
- **Deploy ML models** as production-ready APIs

🔗 See [lesson-5-ml-pipeline/README.md](lesson-5-ml-pipeline/README.md) for step-by-step usage.

---

### 5. `lesson-6-ci-cd/` – CI/CD with GitHub Actions -testing
**Objective**: Automate ML workflows with CI/CD

- Extend the ML pipeline by integrating **CI/CD** using **GitHub Actions**
- **Automate testing** of ML models and data
- **Automate building** and deployment of Docker containers
- **Continuous integration** for ML projects
- **Production deployment** best practices

🔗 See [lesson-6-ci-cd/README.md](lesson-6-ci-cd/README.md) for automation setup and workflow explanation.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Port conflicts**: Some lessons use port 5000 (macOS AirPlay conflict) - use port 8000 instead
- **MLflow UI issues**: Use `mlflow ui --port 5001` to avoid conflicts
- **Docker permission errors**: Ensure Docker is running and you have proper permissions
- **GitHub Actions**: Check the Actions tab for workflow status and logs

### Getting Help
- Check individual lesson README files for specific troubleshooting
- Review error messages in terminal output
- Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed
