# Day 1: MLOps / LLMOps Foundation ‚Äì Bootcamp

Welcome to **Day 1** of the MLOps/LLMOps Bootcamp! This repository contains a set of **hands-on exercises** that introduce core concepts and tools for machine learning operations. You'll work with tools like **Git**, **MLflow**, **Docker**, and **CI/CD pipelines**, building real workflows from development to deployment.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 1, you will be able to:
- **Version control** ML code using Git
- **Track experiments** and model performance with MLflow
- **Containerize** ML applications using Docker
- **Build complete ML pipelines** with preprocessing, training, and deployment
- **Automate CI/CD** workflows using GitHub Actions
- **Deploy ML models** as production-ready APIs

---

## üìÅ Repository Structure Overview

### 1. `lesson-2-git/` ‚Äì Version Control with Git
**Objective**: Learn Git fundamentals for ML project management

- Implement a **Random Forest model** on the **Iris dataset**
- Learn **Git commands** for version control
- Track code changes and collaborate effectively

üîó See [lesson-2-git/README.md](lesson-2-git/README.md) for details and instructions.

---

### 2. `lesson-3-mlflow/` ‚Äì Experiment Tracking with MLflow
**Objective**: Master experiment tracking and model management

- Track **Logistic Regression model** for **air quality classification**
- Use **MLflow Tracking UI** for experiment visualization
- Log parameters, metrics, and model versions
- Compare different model runs

üîó See [lesson-3-mlflow/README.md](lesson-3-mlflow/README.md) for details and setup.

---

### 3. `lesson-4-docker/` ‚Äì Model Deployment with Docker
**Objective**: Containerize ML applications for consistent deployment

- Build and deploy an **Age Detection model** using **Flask**
- Containerize the application using **Docker**
- Learn to run ML models as APIs in isolated environments
- Understand containerization benefits

üîó See [lesson-4-docker/README.md](lesson-4-docker/README.md) for Docker usage and running the app.

### 4. `lesson-5-ml-pipeline/` ‚Äì ML Pipeline with MLflow & Flask
**Objective**: Build end-to-end ML pipelines

- Implement a complete **machine learning pipeline** for income classification
- **Data preprocessing pipeline** with feature engineering
- **Model training** with experiment tracking via MLflow
- **Model deployment** using Flask & Docker
- **Production-ready** ML application

üîó See [lesson-5-ml-pipeline/README.md](lesson-5-ml-pipeline/README.md) for step-by-step usage.

---

### 5. `lesson-6-ci-cd/` ‚Äì CI/CD with GitHub Actions -testing
**Objective**: Automate ML workflows with CI/CD

- Extend the ML pipeline by integrating **CI/CD** using **GitHub Actions**
- **Automate testing** of ML models and data
- **Automate building** and deployment of Docker containers
- **Continuous integration** for ML projects
- **Production deployment** best practices

üîó See [lesson-6-ci-cd/README.md](lesson-6-ci-cd/README.md) for automation setup and workflow explanation.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Port conflicts**: Some lessons use port 5000 (macOS AirPlay conflict) - use port 8000 instead
- **MLflow UI issues**: Use `mlflow ui --port 5001` to avoid conflicts
- **Docker permission errors**: Ensure Docker is running and you have proper permissions
- **GitHub Actions**: Check the Actions tab for workflow status and logs

### Getting Help
- Check individual lesson README files for specific troubleshooting
- Review error messages in terminal output
- Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed
