In the world of machine learning, tracking experiments is crucial for ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and effective model management. MLflow allows us to log not only parameters, metrics, and models but also track and compare multiple experiments over time. This makes it easier to optimize model performance, fine-tune hyperparameters, and maintain a history of all experiments for future reference.\n","\n","In this notebook, we will use MLflow to track and manage the development of a classification model aimed at predicting **air quality**. Our dataset contains various environmental features, including temperature, humidity, pollutant levels (such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO), and factors like proximity to industrial areas and population density. By building a predictive model, we aim to classify air quality into categories like \"Good\" , \"Moderate\" or \"Hazardous\" based on these features. Throughout the process, we will log every aspect of the model training and evaluation, from hyperparameters to performance metrics, ensuring we have a clear and organized record of our work with MLflow."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0qFxgxeKOBMB"},"outputs":[],"source":["# import Libraries\n","import mlflow\n","import mlflow.sklearn\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Eeoktt5XOcCv","outputId":"2fb94b4e-7a83-4868-fe55-e2e786f81030"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["   Temperature  Humidity  PM2.5  PM10   NO2   SO2    CO  \\\n","0         29.8      59.1    5.2  17.9  18.9   9.2  1.72   \n","1         28.3      75.6    2.3  12.2  30.8   9.7  1.64   \n","2         23.1      74.7   26.7  33.8  24.4  12.6  1.63   \n","3         27.1      39.1    6.1   6.3  13.5   5.3  1.15   \n","4         26.5      70.7    6.9  16.0  21.9   5.6  1.01   \n","\n","   Proximity_to_Industrial_Areas  Population_Density Air Quality  \n","0                            6.3                 319    Moderate  \n","1                            6.0                 611    Moderate  \n","2                            5.2                 619    Moderate  \n","3                           11.1                 551        Good  \n","4                           12.7                 303        Good  \n"]}],"source":["# Load the dataset from a CSV file\n","df = pd.read_csv('air_quality.csv')  # Replace with the path to your CSV file\n","\n","# Check the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure\n","print(df.head())\n","\n","# Feature columns and target variable\n","X = df.drop('Air Quality', axis=1)\n","y = df['Air Quality']\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"YAKM1FD7OgKG"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Encode the target variable (Air Quality) using Label Encoding\n","label_encoder = LabelEncoder()\n","y_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(y)\n","\n","# Standardize the features\n","scaler = StandardScaler()\n","X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"3HZ0f3L8OiIH"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y_encoded, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"WD79ugSM1tQN"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define model hyperparameters\n","params = {\n","    \"solver\": \"lbfgs\",\n","    \"max_iter\": 1000,\n","    \"random_state\": 42,\n","}\n","\n","# Train the model\n","lr = LogisticRegression(**params)\n","lr.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","# Predict on the test set\n","y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)\n","\n","# Calculate evaluation metrics\n","accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n","precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average=\"weighted\")\n","recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average=\"weighted\")\n","f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average=\"weighted\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CBmPlppoOlQJ"},"source":["### Experiment Tracking\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1eBrQD7AO5wJ"},"source":["Before we begin training our model, the first thing we need to do is define and set an experiment in MLflow.\n","\n","- **Experiment:** In MLflow, an experiment acts as a container that holds all the runs (individual model training sessions) related to a specific task or project.\n","- **Run:** A run represents a single execution of a machine learning model, including its parameters, metrics, and results.
